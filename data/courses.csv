We are offering various specific tailormade courses during the academic year related e.g., game audio (new audio technologies, middleware), XR-technologies (AR, VR telepresence), game art, programming and game business. The need for this course rises from the need of the game community, game production programme and the stakeholders from the industry 
 
After completing this course, you will learn new game industry competence in an advanced level which is useful in your career within game industry.

Game Production Competence 
 
The learning objectives of the course 
The content varies and it depends on the resources and needs of the game community. There will be one to two different courses implementations during the academic year and those who have basic or advanced skills and competences in that particular field are able to join the course.","In this implementation of Advanced Content for Games we have two specialization groups: one for narrative and one for game audio. 

The narrative group will deepen their knowledge of narrative design by joining the Jyväskylä Game Theatre (JGT). All roles of the production are needed, for example writers, light/sound designers, costume and set designers and actors. At the end of the course there will be the world premiere of the first JGT show.  

The audio group will deepen their knowledge of sound design and immersive audio by utilizing the Dolby Atmos system in Unity or Unreal. Previous experience in either composing/sound design OR game engines is expected, but not both. The students' work will be showcased to the public at a later agreed-upon event.  

The course is implemented as face-to-face guidance and workshops with the main emphasis on group work on the course projects. All students have their individual bespoke goals during the course. 

If a student wishes to attend the course, but does not fit in with the groups above, they can contact the course tutor and discuss their situation.  

All students who enroll on the course are expected to conduct a pre-task and a letter of motivation, which will be used as an application for the course.","Because of the nature of the course and its alternating topics, the content of the course varies. This course is dedicated to those who are already at a certain level in a specific field and the course is offered not only for the JAMK students but everybody who is motivated, engaged, and has previous skills in the area. The idea is also to support a special advanced community within that particular field to increase crowdsourcing and knowledge sharing among peers.","Horowitz S.

Have you ever had the experience of using a program that has had features that were annoying, or could have been done so much better?

Difference between good and excellent products is often usability and user experience (UX). In order to develop a first class software, users should be involved throughout the design and implementation processes.

In practice, the point of this course is the basics of usability - definitions, psychological heuristics, character laws etc. These apply to both web-applications and games - and of course to all other artifacts. Various design and evaluation methods are tested, from card sorting to user testing. The user-driven design package then focuses on assessing user needs, and the methods that support them.

- User-centered design processes and techniques
- User experience
- Usability
- Basics of cognitive psychology
- Usability testing

In group work it is vital that all group members are on the same page when developing a game. If there is a mutual understanding where everybody agrees that ok, our game is a horror-scary genre game what does that really mean? Is it a scary game for 10-year old people or for adults? Horror means different things for different people and that is why it is important to make decent concept art and characters visible in very early stage of the project
